Lando + Drop: Automate a Drupal download, install and launch by almost zero config

# Usage

```
landrop init my-govcms

landrop launch
```
This will download, install and launch a GovCMS instance!

# Install
You need to have `lando` installed. That's pretty much it.

# Configuration
You can change the Drupal core version and distribution in `example-drop.yml`

# TODO
Allow configuration without needing to modify the landrop repository.
